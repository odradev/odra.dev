# Odra.toml

As mentioned in the previous article, `Odra.toml` is a file that contains information about all the contracts
that Odra will build. Let's take a look at the file structure again:

```toml
[[contracts]]
name = "flipper"
fqn = "sample::Flipper"
```

The `name` will be used as a name for the contract - the generated wasm file will be in the above case named
`flipper.wasm`.

The `fqn` (Fully Qualified Name) is used by the builder to locate the exact struct where
the contract is defined.

## Adding a new contract manually

Besides using the `cargo odra generate` command, you can add a new contract to be compiled by hand.
To do this, add another `[[contracts]]` element, name it and make sure that the `fqn` is set correctly.

For example, if you want to create a new contract called `counter`, your `Odra.toml` file should finally
look like this:

```toml
[[contracts]]
name = "flipper"
fqn = "sample::Flipper"

[[contracts]]
name = "counter"
fqn = "sample::Counter"
```

## What's next
In the next section, we'll take a closer look at the code that was generated by Odra by default - the famous
`Flipper` contract.
