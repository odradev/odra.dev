# Odra.toml

As mentioned in previous article, Odra.toml is a file that contains information about all the contracts
that Odra will build. Let's take a look at the file structure again:

```toml
[[contracts]]
name = "flipper"
fqn = "sample::Flipper"
```

The `name` will be used as a name for the contract - the generated wasm file will be in above case named
`flipper.wasm`.

The `fqn` (Fully Qualified Name) on the other hand is used by the builder to locate the exact struct where the contract is
defined.

## Adding a new contract manually

Beside using the `cargo odra generate` command, you can add new contract to be compiled by hand.
To do this, add another `[[contracts]]` element, name it and make sure that the fqn is set correctly.

For example, if you want to create a new contract called `counter`, your Odra.toml file should finally
look like this:

```toml
[[contracts]]
name = "flipper"
fqn = "sample::Flipper"

[[contracts]]
name = "counter"
fqn = "sample::Counter"
```

## What's next
In the next section we'll take a closer look at the code that was generated by Odra by default - the famous
Flipper contract.
