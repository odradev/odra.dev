# Odra framework

Odra is a high-level smart contract framework for Rust, which encourages rapid development and clean,
pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of smart contract
development, enabling you to focus on writing your dapp without reinventing the wheel. It's free and open
source.

Odra's goal is to become the go-to smart contract framework for all WebAssembly-based blockchains.

A smart contract written using Odra can be executed on all integrated systems. We can do it
by abstracting over core concepts that all the above systems are built around. These are type system,
storage, entry points, execution context, and testing environment. We believe it will bring standardization
to the development of Rust-based smart contracts and enable code reusability we have not yet seen in this
ecosystem.
